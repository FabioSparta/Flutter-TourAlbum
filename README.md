 This project was made for ICM class using flutter

 Tour Album is an application meant for users who want to save photos of their trips. It has a map so you can see where you are and what's close to you
and a camera to take photos. Photos taken using our app will be saved to the user's gallery with time and location of the photo making it easy to see all your photos.
